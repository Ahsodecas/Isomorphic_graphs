## Overview
A program that checks whether two simple graphs are isomorphic.
## How to use
The input to the program is the number of nodes of a graph and the neighboring nodes of each node. The input should be provided for the first and the second graph.

For example, the input for the graph above is the following.

If the graphs are isomorphic, the output includes instructions on how to transform one graph into the other. (example from unit_tests.py test_isomorphic_graphs1)
